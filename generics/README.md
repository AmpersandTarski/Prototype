# Generics folder
This folder is historically called 'generics' and contains the prototype framework configuration files that are generated by the Ampersand compiler.

## Compiler version constraints
As of Ampersand compiler version 5.x, the compiler checks if its version is compatible with the deployed prototype framework. The prototype framework specifies the compatible compiler version(s) by means of semantic versioning constraints specified in [compiler-version.txt](./compiler-version.txt).

The compiler uses Haskell package [Salve](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/salve) to check the constraints. See documentation of Salve to understand the contraint language.

## Generated files by Ampersand compiler
All generated config and ampersand model files will be placed in this folder. This includes:
* concepts.json
* conjuncts.json
* interfaces.json
* mysql-installer.json
* relations.json
* roles.json
* rules.json
* settings.json
* views.json
