## v1.0.1 (27 july 2018)
Several bugfixes. See commit messages.

## v1.0.0 (26 june 2018)
Initial version of Ampersand prototype framework in its own repository. Earlier the complete prototype framework was included (zipped) in the [Ampersand generator](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/Ampersand). As of this release the prototype framework, including a PHP backend and a HTML/JS frontend implementation are maintained in a [seperate repository](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/Prototype). This enables us to add automated tests and CI/CD more easily. For more background see related issue [Ampersand #756](https://github.com/AmpersandTarski/Ampersand/issues/756).
