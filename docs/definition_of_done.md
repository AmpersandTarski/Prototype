# Definition of Done

This is our Definition of Done. Both for the now, and our ambitions for the future.

## Now

These are the activities that have been completed when an issue is moved to Done.
Copy them into the issues that are taken into progress, and check the activities that are done.

- [ ] Agreed ready for implementation.
- [ ] Coding finished and checked in.
- [ ] Manually tested.
- [ ] Documentation partially updated.
- [ ] Peer review performed.
- [ ] Merged to main branch.

### Agreed ready for implementation

This means that at least one or (preferably) two developers understand the requirements sufficiently to start implementation. 
It should be checked during sprint planning.

This activity acts as an alternative for the more formally defined Definition of Ready for issues.

### Manually tested

This means that the developer has performed his/her own testing manually. Optionally the peer reviewer(s) can also have performed such tests.

### Documentation partially updated 

This means that existing documentation has been updated

## Future

There are some activities we would like to include in our Definition of Done, but that require some preparation.

### Documentation fully updated

Documentation should be fully updated as part of an issue being done. 

But for that to work we need to update and complete current documentation.

### Unit tests implemented and completed sucessfully

There should be a unit testing framework in place. With that we should implement unit tests as part of our Definition of Done.  

### Functional tests implemented and completed sucessfully

Functional tests implemented means that required functional tests have been identified, built and run succesfully.

The initial implementation for a the functional testing framework has just been finished. We need to gain some experience with it, 
define a test plan and set up the basic required tests.
