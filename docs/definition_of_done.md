# Definition of Done

## Now

These are the activities that have been completed when an issue is moved to Done.

- [ ] Coding finished and checked in.
- [ ] Developer tested.
- [ ] Documentation partially updated.
- [ ] Peer review performed.

- Functional tests implemented means that required functional tests have been identified and have
