## How to install and start up the local instance?
1. First, install the project files from this github repo to your computer. 
2. Open a command prompt (for windows users cmd is alright) and navigate to the root folder of the project where you just installed it to. 
3. Use `npm install` to install all the dependencies of the project, this can take a short amount of time.
4. To run the project, type `npm start`. This command will execute the `npm serve` command to start up the local instance of the project. 

When you already have installed the project and it's dependencies on your computer and want to start it up again, repeat stap 2 and 4 to run the local instance of the project.
